# UsefulClasses
Pretty much only for personal use, but some classes that I find useful and use pretty often

This doesn't have a proper README, since it's not really supposed to be used, and is honestly only here for my reference. The classes themselves should be simple enough to use, if you need them. Not all code is mine, and if I use other's code, I will link credit inside the class.
